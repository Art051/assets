# assets
PostgreSQL with Spring Web API


API Practice using Spring Web, JPA, PostgreSQL.

Aim was to create an API which would allow the compilation of a list of assets held by a person/entity and keep track of location, description, price.
Idea came about when preparing a spreadsheet trying to list house contents when buying home contents insurance.
